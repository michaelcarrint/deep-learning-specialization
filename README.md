# 🧠 Deep Learning Specialization Projects by Andrew Ng

Welcome! This repository contains all my personal code, notes, and 
practice exercises as I work through the **[Deep Learning 
Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)** 
by Andrew Ng on Coursera.

I’m building everything **from scratch** using **Python** and **NumPy** — 
no deep learning frameworks (like TensorFlow or PyTorch) unless needed. 
This helps me truly understand how deep learning works **under the hood**.

## 🚀 Why I'm Doing This

As a self-taught learner, I’m on a mission to build a better future 
through AI and machine learning — starting with the fundamentals. This 
repo documents that journey, project by project.

## 📚 What’s Inside

Each week’s project is in its own folder with:
- ✅ Clean, well-commented Python code
- 📓 My personal notes or markdown explanations
- 📊 Visualizations (like loss curves)

### Courses Covered:

1. **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**
   - [x] Week 1: Logistic Regression with a Neural Network Mindset
   - [x] Week 2: Python & Vectorization, Activation Functions
   - [ ] Week 3: Shallow Neural Networks
   - [ ] Week 4: Deep Neural Networks
   
2. **Improving Deep Neural Networks**
   - [ ] Regularization, Gradient Checking, Initialization
   - [ ] Hyperparameter Tuning, Batch Norm, Optimization

3. **Structuring Machine Learning Projects**
4. **Convolutional Neural Networks**
5. **Sequence Models**

(✅ = completed, 🛠️ = in progress)

## 💡 Why Follow This Repo?

If you're:
- A **beginner** starting deep learning
- Looking to understand how models really work
- Wanting to see **code-first learning** from scratch

Then this repo will feel like a helpful roadmap. I'm documenting 
everything in a way that’s easy to follow — even if you’re just starting.

## 🌱 My Future Goals

- Complete the full specialization
- Rebuild key models in PyTorch
- Work on real-world projects with real data
- Start open-source collaborations
