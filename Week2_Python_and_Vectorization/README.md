# 🧠 Student Exam Pass Predictor (Logistic Regression)

## 💡 Goal
Predict whether a student will pass an exam based on habits like study 
time, sleep, practice, social media use, and class attendance.

## 🛠️ Tools
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Logistic Regression (from scratch!)

## 📊 Features Used
- Hours studied
- Hours of sleep
- Practice problems completed
- Ate breakfast (Yes/No)
- Used social media (Yes/No)
- Attended class (Yes/No)

## 🔍 What I Learned
- How to build a logistic regression model from scratch
- Why **feature scaling (standardization)** is important
- How to fix increasing loss
- How to calculate accuracy and visualize training

## 🧪 Example Result
- Final Accuracy: `90%`
- Loss curve:
